# Contributing

Thank you, for considering contributing to this action. To allow feature integration in a backward compatiable way, this repository uses unit tests.

That said, contributing is not just writing code. It entails

1. Reporting bugs
  - First check if a similar [issue](issues) is not already present, before [creating a new](issues/new).
2. Feature Suggestions
  - New feature suggestions are also managed through [issues](issues).
3. Pull Requests
  - Just make sure all tests pass, and you have included tests for your additions.
